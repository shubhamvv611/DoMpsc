              <li>Stage 3-Dispersed or isolated incidence of diseases or small groups of diseases in humans; possible cases of human-to-human transmission, but did not lead to community-level outbreaks</li>
              <li>Stage 4-The speed of transmission between people leads to a community outbreak</li>

                       ➤Bacteria are classified into 5 groups according to their basic shapes: spherical (cocci), rod (bacilli), spiral (spirilla), comma (vibrios) or corkscrew (spirochaetes) <br>
                        ➤ <b>Spherical:</b> Bacteria shaped like a ball are called cocci, and a single bacterium is a coccus. Examples include the streptococcus group, responsible for “strep throat.” <br> 
                        ➤ <b>Rod-shaped:</b> These are known as bacilli (singular bacillus). Some rod-shaped bacteria are curved. These are known as vibrio. Examples of rod-shaped bacteria include Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis), or anthrax. <br>
                        ➤ <b> Spiral:</b> These are known as spirilla (singular spirillus). If their coil is very tight they are known as spirochetes. Leptospirosis, Lyme disease, and syphilis are caused by bacteria of this shape <br>
                       ➤ Bacterial Diseases:Infectious disease,Cholera,Leprosy,Tuberculosis,Plague,Syphilis,Anthrax.   <br>

                       <h2 class="badge badge-warning">Viruses</h2><br>
                       ➤ an infective agent that typically consists of a nucleic acid molecule in a protein coat, is too small to be seen by light microscopy, and is able to multiply only within the living cells of a host.. <br>
                       ➤Viruses are small parasites that cannot reproduce on their own. <br>
                       ➤The virus is named based on its genetic structure to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and drugs. <br>
                       ➤They Are non cellular in nature. <br>
                       ➤ They are very small as compare with bacteria. <br>
                       ➤ they have either DNA or RNA in a body.Simultaneously DNA or RNA not present</br>
                       ➤ They never Generate there Food.<br>
                       ➤ The entire infectious virus particle (called virion) is composed of a shell of nucleic acid and protein..<br>
                       ➤ The simplest virus contains only enough RNA or DNA to encode four proteins.<br>
                       ➤  Example:Hepatitis A,Hepatitis B,Human papillomavirus (HPV,Influenza,Japanese encephalitis (inflammation of the brain,Measles, mumps, and rubella,Polio,Rabies,Smallpox,Chickenpox.<br>

                       ➤Fungi are usually divided into four parts: chytrids (chytrids), zygote (bread mold), ascomycetes (yeast and cyst fungi) and basidiomycetes (club fungi). <br>
                       ➤ about 144,000 known species of organisms of the kingdom Fungi. <br>
                       ➤ Fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics. <br>
