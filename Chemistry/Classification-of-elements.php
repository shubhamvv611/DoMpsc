              ➤ All this  are classified on the basis of a physical and some chemical properties.<br>
              ➤There are certain properties like Examples of chemical properties include flammability, toxicity, acidity, reactivity.<br>

              ➤ Metallic luster is a property of a metal that describes the amount of light that reflects off the metal. In other words, it describes the shine. <br>
              ➤  Light reflection property are increase due to lustre property of a metal. <br>

            ➤Ductility refers to the time a solid material stretches under tensile strain..<br>
            ➤If ductile, a material may be stretched into a wire. Malleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under pressure (compressive stress).<br>
            ➤Copper, aluminum and steel are examples of ductile metals.<br>
            ➤ Gold are more ductile in nature.</br>

            <b class="badge badge-warning">✪ Conduction of Heat ✪</b><br>
            
            ➤Transformation of a energy from a metal is conduction of a heat.<br>
            ➤ The microscopic collision of particles and the movement of electrons in the body perform the conduction.<br>
            ➤  Colliding molecules (including molecules, atoms and electrons) transfer disordered microscopic kinetic energy and potential energy, collectively called internal energy.<br>
            ➤The conduction equation tells us that the rate of heat transfer in Joules or Watts per second (Q/t) is equal to the thermal conductivity of the material (k).<br>
            ➤The heat conduction equation is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat (or temperature field) in a given object over time.<br>
            ➤Eg.Roasting wieners over a campfire is fun until the heat from the fire is conducted up the coat hanger to your hand.<br>

                    ➤Conductivity is the movement of charged particles through a transmission medium.<br>
                    ➤ This movement can form an electric current in response to an electric field.. <br>
                    ➤ Metal conducts electricity by moving electrons. The outermost electrons in the metal are loosely fixed so they can move from one atom to another. <br>
                    ➤ Copper is considered a conductor because it "conducts" electron current or electron flow quite easily. Most metals are considered good current conductors..<br>
                    ➤ Electrical conductors allow current to flow easily due to their atomic composition. In a conductor, the external electrons of the atom are loosely bound and can freely pass through the material when a charge is applied..<br>
                   ➤Conduction occurs in solids, liquids and gases. ... Another example is when the current is passing through the conductor’s wires, we can watch TV or use a computer. <br>

                    ➤The ability of a material to resist impact depression is related to the hardness and ductility of the material. <br>
                    ➤The most commonly used hardness test is defined by the shape or type of indentation, the size and the amount of load applied. <br>
                    ➤ In terms of tensile strength, tungsten is the strongest of all natural metals (142,000 psi). But in terms of impact strength, tungsten is very weak-it is a brittle metal that is known to shatter under impact. On the other hand, the tensile strength of titanium is 63,000 psi.<br>

                   ➤When a metal melts or boils, this is a change in physical state <br>
                   ➤This energy is needed to overcome the attraction between metal ions and localized electrons in the metal <br>
                   ➤The more energy required, the higher the melting or boiling point.. <br>

                  <br id="Sonorous">
                   <h3 class="badge badge-warning">✪ Sonorous ✪</h3><br>
                   ➤Electronic bonds in metals are highly delocalized due to their extremely low electronegativity.<br>
➤ This means that when struck, the electron cloud moves very easily-almost no energy is dissipated <br>
                    ➤This makes the incoming kinetic energy easy to spread in an unbalanced form-fluctuations..  <br>
                    ➤Metal is inherently elastic, such as iron, tin, copper, etc. When we hit metal (surface), especially thin plates, it has elasticity. Even wires (musical instruments).  <br>
                    ➤The elasticity of metals makes them vibrate back and forth, creating ripples in the fluid medium (water or air). It sounds pretty good!.  <br>
                    ➤Silver is very flexible. There will be a very sharp sound when impacted. Therefore, it is the loudest metal.<br>

                   ➤ Metal oxides are formed when metals are react with a oxygens. <br>
                   ➤ When metals react with oxygen, metal oxides are formed. The general formula for this reaction is: metal + oxygen → metal oxide. <br>
                   ➤ The transition metal reacts with oxygen to form a metal oxide. However, gold, silver and platinum will not react with oxygen. <br>
                   ➤ Generally, metals react with oxygen to form metal oxides. Generally, the metal oxide is ionic compound #. ...The less active metals react with oxygen more easily than the less active metals. Generally, Group 1 (IA or alkali) metals and Group 2 (IIA or alkaline earth) metals are more active than transition metals.. <br>
                   ➤ 4Na + O2 = 2NA20 <br>

                   ➤ When Metals react with acid it produce salt.<br>
                   ➤ When an acid reacts with a metal, salt and hydrogen are formed: acid + metal → salt + hydrogen, for example: nitric acid + calcium → calcium nitrate + hydrogen The salt produced depends on which acid and which metal react.<br>
                   ➤ Acids will react with most metals and will form salts. It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if a reaction occurs, we always get hydrogen and salt.<br>
                   ➤ Copper is a very unreactive metal, and it does not react with hydrochloric acid<br>

                   <h3 class="badge badge-danger">✪ Non Metal ✪</h3><br>
                  <strong>Q.What is NonMetal ?</strong> <br>
            ➤Non-metal is a chemical element, mainly lacking the characteristics of metal. Physically, non-metals tend to have relatively low melting points, boiling points, and densities. Non-metals usually become brittle when solid, and usually have poor thermal and electrical conductivity.<br>
            ➤ Non-metal atoms tend to be smaller than metal atoms. Some other properties of non-metals are determined by their atomic size..<br>
            ➤ Non-metals exhibit very low conductivity. Low or non-existent conductivity is the most important characteristic to distinguish non-metals from metals..<br>
            ➤ Under normal temperature and pressure conditions, some non-metals are found to be gases, some are solid, and one is liquid. In contrast to mercury, all metals are solid at room temperature. The fact that so many non-metals exist in liquid or gaseous form means that non-metals generally have relatively low melting points and boiling points under normal atmospheric conditions..<br>
            ➤ Non-metals have high electro negativity. This means that non-metal atoms have a strong tendency to hold electrons. On the contrary, metals are relatively easy to donate one or more electrons to non-metals, so metals tend to form positively charged ions, and metals tend to conduct electricity..<br>
            ➤ In its solid state, non-metals tend to become brittle. Therefore, they lack the ductility and ductility exhibited by metals..<br>
            ➤Eg. Carbon, hydrogen,oxygen.<br><br id="Metalloid">            
             <h2 class="badge badge-danger">✪ Metalloid ✪</h2> <br>
                   <strong>Q. What are the properties of metalloid ?</strong><br>
                   ➤ Metalloids are good semiconductors.. <br>
                    ➤ The reactivity of metalloids are dependent on the properties of elements they are reacting with.<br>
                    ➤ Electronegativity and ionization energy are between metals and non-metals..<br>
                    ➤ They are capable of forming glasses. <br>
                    ➤ When mixed with metals, they form alloys<br>
                    ➤Compounds are formed when they react with the halogens.<br>
