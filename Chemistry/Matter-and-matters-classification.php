              Q.What are the types of matter ?<br>
              ➤Solids, liquids, Metalloid and plasma. Bose-Einstein condensates.<br>
              Q. What are the properties of matters ?.<br>
              ➤ The properties of a substance include any feature that can be measured, such as the density, color, mass, volume, length, ductility, melting point, hardness, smell, temperature, etc. of the object.<br>
              ➤ Matter can be broken down into two categories: pure substances and mixtures. <br>
             ➤The first law of thermodynamics does not actually stipulate that matter can neither be created nor destroyed, but that total energy cannot be created or destroyed in a closed system (although it can be changed from one form to another)..<br>

            <b class="badge badge-warning">Metal</b><br>
            <strong>Q. What is called as a metal ?</strong> <br>
            ➤ The Substance which follow some  properties like lustrous, malleable, ductile, good conductors of heat and electricity,High melting point, is called as metal.<br>
            ➤ Electro positive Character is the chemical property of a metal.<br>
            ➤ Metal is one of the three major elements of metalloid and non-metals, and is known for its ionization and bonding properties..<br>
            ➤ Metals easily form alloys with other metals.</br>
            ➤ The behavior of metals as atoms or ions deeply affects the electrochemical reactions they experience, and also affects the metabolism of plants and animals. Iron, copper, cobalt, potassium and sodium are metals essential for biological functions. Certain metals, such as cadmium, mercury, lead, barium, chromium, and beryllium, are highly toxic..</br>
            ➤ Metals are present in the all groups in the periodic table.</br>
            ➤Eg.Iron,Copper,Silver,Gold.<br><br id="NonMetal">
         
            <b class="badge badge-warning">NonMetal</b><br>
            <strong>Q.What is NonMetal ?</strong> <br>
            ➤Non-metal is a chemical element, mainly lacking the characteristics of metal. Physically, non-metals tend to have relatively low melting points, boiling points, and densities. Non-metals usually become brittle when solid, and usually have poor thermal and electrical conductivity.<br>
            ➤ Non-metal atoms tend to be smaller than metal atoms. Some other properties of non-metals are determined by their atomic size..<br>
            ➤ Non-metals exhibit very low conductivity. Low or non-existent conductivity is the most important characteristic to distinguish non-metals from metals..<br>
            ➤ Under normal temperature and pressure conditions, some non-metals are found to be gases, some are solid, and one is liquid. In contrast to mercury, all metals are solid at room temperature. The fact that so many non-metals exist in liquid or gaseous form means that non-metals generally have relatively low melting points and boiling points under normal atmospheric conditions..<br>
            ➤ Non-metals have high electro negativity. This means that non-metal atoms have a strong tendency to hold electrons. On the contrary, metals are relatively easy to donate one or more electrons to non-metals, so metals tend to form positively charged ions, and metals tend to conduct electricity..<br>
            ➤ In its solid state, non-metals tend to become brittle. Therefore, they lack the ductility and ductility exhibited by metals..<br>
            ➤Eg. Carbon, hydrogen,oxygen.<br><br id="Metalloid">            
             <h2 class="badge badge-warning">Metalloid</h2> <br>
                   <strong>Q. What are the properties of metalloid ?</strong><br>
                   ➤ Metalloids are good semiconductors.. <br>
                    ➤ The reactivity of metalloids are dependent on the properties of elements they are reacting with.<br>
                    ➤ Electronegativity and ionization energy are between metals and non-metals..<br>
                    ➤ They are capable of forming glasses. <br>
                    ➤ When mixed with metals, they form alloys<br>
                    ➤Compounds are formed when they react with the halogens.<br>

                    <strong>Q.What is Compound ?</strong><br>
                    ➤ Compounds are substances formed when two or more chemical elements are chemically bonded together. Example 1: Pure water is a compound composed of two elements: hydrogen and oxygen. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen in water is always 2:1. Each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms bonded to a single oxygen atom.<br>
                    ➤ We can not separate compound by physical method <br>
                    ➤It Can be Done with chemical method easily. <br>
                    ➤ They have a properties of a both elements where they are formed of.<br>

               <h2>✪ <u>There are some methods which are used to separate substances from mixture</u> ✪</h2><br id="Centrifugation">
                <h2 class="badge badge-warning">Centrifugation</h2><br>
                ➤ Centrifugation is a technique used to separate solutions from solutions based on their size, shape, density, medium viscosity, and rotor speed.<br>
                 ➤ The particles are suspended in a liquid medium and placed in a centrifuge tube. Then put the tube in the rotor and rotate at the specified speed. <br>
                  ➤ Separation by settlement can be done naturally by the gravity of the earth, but it takes a long time. Centrifugation makes this natural process faster. <br>
                  ➤ The rotation of the rotor around the central axis generates centrifugal force on the particles in the suspension. <br>
                ➤ In this method the substance having high density is remain at top and another goes down <br>
                ➤ Eg.Washing machine <br><br id="Distillation">
                <h2 class="badge badge-warning">Distillation</h2> <br>
                ➤ Distillation is the process of separating components or substances from a liquid mixture by selective boiling and condensation<br>
                ➤ Distillation may result in almost complete separation or partial separation, thereby increasing the concentration of selected components in the mixture<br>
                ➤ Distillation is useful as a separation technique because it helps to separate a mixture of two miscible liquids by boiling and can separate if the temperature exceeds 25 degrees Kelvin (such as water and salt).<br>
                ➤Eg.Remove salt from water <br id="Crystallization">
                <h2 class="badge badge-warning">Crystallization</h2><br>
                ➤ Crystallization or crystallization is the process of forming a solid, in which atoms or molecules are highly organized into structures called crystals.<br>
                ➤ Some methods of crystal formation are precipitation from solution, freezing, or rarely directly from gas<br>
